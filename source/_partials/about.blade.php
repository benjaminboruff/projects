        <p>
            I am a programmer with
            a background in front-end and back-end web development, as well as
            Linux and FreeBSD system administration.
        </p>

        <p>
            My current interests are <a href="https://jamstack.org/">Jamstack</a> related technologies. I have been using
            static site generators such as <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a>, <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, and <a href="">Jigsaw</a>
            on my recent projects. The <a href="https://jamstack.org/">Jamstack</a> philosophy of decoupling the front-end from the back-end, using
            only APIs to connect them -- and typically using headless CMSs as the back-end, is a breath of fresh air.
        </p>

        <p>
            Don't get me wrong, I love back-end frameworks like <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel</a>, <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>, 
            and <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a>, but when the front-end and back-end are so tighly coupled the project can become
            complicated very quickly. And yes, you can certainly use these back-ends to only build APIs, but that is not the typical use-case in my experience
            working as a contract programmer with clients who want an MVP quickly.
